We were able to implement most things but we ran out of time and could not do the following:

Change the colors of the lines that represent edges when weight values changed
Implement the activation function radio buttons
Implement the step to next instance button
Implement alert messages on errors. (and therefore our exception handling is incomplete)

We really struggled to get the bindings correct for the weights and the colors of the edges. We feel our implementation is close but we are missing something minor that is causing them not to work.
